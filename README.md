Youtube Audio 
=============

Extension for turning off video on youtube. Fork of (https://github.com/animeshkundu/youtube-audio)

I mostly listen to songs a lot on youtube while working. The video playing in the background just heats up my laptop, 
eats up my battery and data / bandwidth. Youtube doesn't provide this functionality natively.

Disable video for youtube songs which saves battery life and bandwidth / data.

### New Features Added:
- Remember current time-stamp of video on reload.
- Don't require data permission for all tabs.


Available on firefox - [Youtube Audio by @themontem](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-only-audio/)
